ToDo
====

Dawen:

- CreateIndexRequest
- DeleteIndexRequest
- IndexExistsRequest
- CreateMappingRequest
- CountRequest only term is possible here
- Unit Test for client
- Integration tests for RequestManager
- Helper for Version response compare. (Symfony/Console)
- After helper for response compare refactor requests. I think version base requests are not needed.
- Vagrant boxes for different elasticsearch versions
- documentation of using it
